# NPRB_Chinook_Bioenergetics
This repository contains information about the Chinook Bioenergetic project at the Sitka Sound Science Center. The goal of this project is to create a bioenergetic model for juvenile Chinook salmon on the Yukon river. The project is run in collaboration with the Yukon Delta Fisheries Development Association (YDFDA) and NOAA. This repository will be updated as data is available from the experiment. Please reachout with any questions to twilson@sitkascience.org.

## Background/Outline
The Yukon Chinook fishery has seen historical lows for many years, with commercial fishing closing on the river in 2007 and subsistence fisheries being shut down in 2020. The impact on communities along the Yukon and its many tributaries has been swift and severe. There are many factors contributing to the loss in the salmon populations. Some primary concerns are: bycatch, rising temperatures, loss of habitat etc. This project focuses on the changing climate and rising temperatures in the river and how these changes effect juvenile Chinook salmon. Specifically we are building a model to predict survival rates of out-migrating Chinook smolt, based on temperature and the size of the fish during the time period of out-migration.

## Timeline
Data has been collected on the Yukon by YDFDA since 2014 on juvenile salmon and river health.
